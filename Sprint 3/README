# Project 1 API

## Usage

### Gotchas
- the comments array starts out with two comments in it already
- this API has a temporary memory. It will sometimes forget all of it's comments (except for the two starter comments)

### URL
`https://project-1-api.herokuapp.com/`

### Authentication
- you must append `?api_key=<your_api_key_here>` to each of your API requests (except for `login`)
- you are free to choose whatever string you want for your API key (like your name)
  - if you want to get a more realistic api key, make a request to `/login`

## `GET /comments`
- Returns an array of comments
- Comments will be regularly cleared
- Timestamp is in ms since epoch.
